# FinEtoolsFlexStructures.jl

[`FinEtools`](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/FinEtools.jl) used for 
- Simulations of large-displacement response of three-dimensional flexible-beam structures. Linear static analysis, modal analysis, linear buckling analysis. Nonlinear statics and dynamics;
- Simulations of shell structures. Linear static analysis, modal analysis, explicit dynamic analysis. Shells can be homogeneous or layered (laminated, composite).

## Current limitations

- Only elastic structures can be modeled.
- Only simple solid beam cross sections are implemented. Open thin-walled beams cannot be simulated at this point since the warping of the section is not enabled.
- Shell reference surface offset not yet tested.
- Neither beams nor shells can be attached with an offset (eccentricity).

## Testing

The package `FinEtoolsFlexStructures.jl` is registered. Simply do
```
using Pkg; Pkg.add("FinEtoolsFlexStructures"); 
Pkg.test("FinEtoolsFlexStructures"); 
```

The package can also be cloned.
Let us assume that the working directory   is `"FinEtoolsFlexStructures.jl"`, 
which is the result of cloning the repository.
The present package can be tested with
```
using Pkg; Pkg.activate("."); Pkg.instantiate(); 
using Pkg; Pkg.test(); 
```

## Examples

The project was developed with Julia 1.6.4, and is operational with any version above that.

Let us assume that the working directory   is `"FinEtoolsFlexStructures.jl"`, perhaps
as a result of cloning the repository.

The project needed for running examples can be activated and initialized by
```
using Pkg; Pkg.activate("./examples"); Pkg.instantiate(); using Revise
```

There are a number of examples, which may be executed as described in the conceptual guide to [`FinEtools`](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/FinEtools.jl). As an example:

There is usually some indication of what the correct answer should be in 
the document string of the module: refer to the Julia file defining the examples.

## Visualization

This is possible with [PlotlyJS.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/PlotlyJS.jl) with the package [`VisualStructures`](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/VisualStructures.jl).
Static plots or animation of deformation during a static or dynamic simulation can be done.

Export to  [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/)  is also available. Static
pictures and time collections (useful for animations) are supported this way.
