# FinEtoolsFlexStructures.jl

[`FinEtools`](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/FinEtools.jl) used for 
- Simulations of large-displacement response of three-dimensional flexible-beam structures. Linear static analysis, modal analysis, linear buckling analysis. Nonlinear statics and dynamics;
- Simulations of shell structures. Linear static analysis, modal analysis.

## Current limitations

- Only elastic structures can be modeled.
- Only simple solid beam cross sections are implemented. Open thin-walled beams cannot be simulated at this point since the warping of the section is not enabled.
- Shells need to be homogeneous. The layered model suitable for laminates and such is not implemented yet.
- Neither beams nor shells can be attached with an offset (eccentricity).

## News

- 12/14/2021: The shell element T3FF fully tested, and described in a paper (to be submitted).
- 08/18/2021: Implemented fully linear statics and dynamics of shells using the DSG triangle with various improvements. Robust and accurate element.
- 05/23/2021: Updated for Julia 1.6.
- 08/23/2020: Added a separate tutorial package, [FinEtoolsFlexStructuresTutorials.jl](https://petrkryslucsd.github.io/FinEtoolsFlexStructuresTutorials.jl)).
- 08/16/2020: Described the tutorials.
- 07/27/2020: Added documentation.
- 02/25/2020: Beams: Nonlinear static analysis implemented.
- 02/20/2020: Beams: Nonlinear transient dynamic analysis implemented.
- 02/16/2020: Beams: Buckling analysis implemented.

## Testing

Let us assume that the working directory   is `"FinEtoolsFlexStructures.jl"`, perhaps
as a result of cloning the repository.
The present package can be tested with
```
using Pkg; Pkg.activate("."); Pkg.instantiate(); 
using Pkg; Pkg.test(); 
```

## Examples

The project was developed with Julia 1.6, and is operational with any version above that.

Let us assume that the working directory   is `"FinEtoolsFlexStructures.jl"`, perhaps
as a result of cloning the repository.

The project needed for running examples can be activated and initialized by
```
using Pkg; Pkg.activate("./Examples"); Pkg.instantiate(); using Revise
```

There are a number of examples, which may be executed as described in the conceptual guide to [`FinEtools`](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/FinEtools.jl). As an example:
```
julia> include(".\\Examples\\shells\\dynamics\\dcbs_vibration_examples.jl")                                                        
WARNING: replacing module dbcs_vibration_examples.                                              
Main.dbcs_vibration_examples  
                                                                                                
julia> dbcs_vibration_examples.allrun() 
```

## Visualization

This is possible using [PlotlyJS.jl](https://github.com/JuliaPlots/PlotlyJS.jl) with the package [`Examples`](https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/Examples.VisUtilModule.jl) (module `VisUtilModule`).
Animation of deformation during a static or dynamic simulation can be done with `PlotlyJS`.

Export to  [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org/)  is also available. Only static pictures are supported this way.
