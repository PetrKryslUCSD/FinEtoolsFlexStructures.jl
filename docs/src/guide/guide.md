The [`FinEtoolsFlexStructures`]
(https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/FinEtoolsFlexStructures.jl)
package is used to solve static and dynamic linear and nonlinear  problems
involving beams and linear static and dynamic analysis of shells.

The basic functionality is provided by the [`FinEtools`]
(https://github.com/PetrKryslUCSD/FinEtools.jl)
package.

To understand how the package works, we would suggest inspecting the examples.
The examples are organized by category: statics, dynamics, etc. There is
usually an indication of what the correct answer should be
(frequencies, deflections, buckling factors, ...). Many examples correspond to
well-known benchmarks.
