# GARTEUR SM-AG19 Testbed: Construction of the geometry

Source code: [`garteur_geometry_vis_tut.jl`](garteur_geometry_vis_tut.jl)

## Description

This virtual test application is based on the test article
used by the GARTEUR Structures & Materials Action Group 19
which organized a Round Robin exercise where 12 European laboratories
tested a single structure between 1995 and 1997. The benchmark structure
was a laboratory structure built to simulate the dynamic behaviour
of an aeroplane. The structure was initially built for a benchmark
study on experimental modal analysis conducted by the
Structures and Materials Action Group (SM-AG19) of the Group
for Aeronautical Research and Technology in EURope (GARTEUR).
The test-bed was designed and manufactured by ONERA, France.

## Goals

- Show how to construct model from multiple connected beams.
- Demonstrate the use of massless connectors.
- Visualize the structure interactively.

## Geometry of the testbed airplane.

The aluminum testbed was a rather simple structure which was reasonably
dynamically representative of a simple airplane structure [GARTEUR](@ref
References). It was composed of several beams simulating a fuselage with wings
and a tail. Wing tip drums allowed to adjust bending and torsion frequencies
similarly to airplane ones, with some very close modal frequencies.

The script included below defines the geometry of the structure, the
cross-sectional properties, the connectivity, and the location of the nodes.

````julia
include("garteur_geometry_tut.jl")
````

## Basic visualization

Here we use the `PlotlyJS` plotting library, with some simple utilities for
generating geometry of beams.

````julia
using PlotlyJS
using VisualStructures: plot_solid, plot_space_box, render, default_layout_3d, save_to_json
````

The colors are used to help distinguish between the individual parts of the model.

````julia
colors = [
"rgb(125, 155, 155)",  # 1 body
"rgb(125, 155, 155)",  # 2 wing
"rgb(125, 155, 155)",  # 3 drums
"rgb(125, 155, 155)",  # 4 vertical tail
"rgb(125, 155, 155)",  # 5 horizontal tail
"rgb(125, 155, 155)",  # 6 constraining plate
"rgb(15, 15, 155)",  # 7 massless connectors: wing beam to plate
"rgb(125, 15, 15)",  # 8 massless connectors: wing beam to drums
"rgb(125, 175, 15)",  # 9 massless connectors: fuselage to wing beam
"rgb(125, 175, 15)",  # 10 massless connectors: fuselage to tail
"rgb(15, 155, 155)",  # 11 massless connectors: sensors, point masses
]
````

The geometry is defined in terms of "traces" (a trace is in the `PlotlyJS`
parlance a graphical object; it could be a curve, surface, and a lot of other
things). It is the name for a graphical object in `PlotlyJS`. The two points
below define a box, which is helpful when setting the extents of the graphics
display.

````julia
tbox = plot_space_box([[-1.2 * L -1.2 * L -1.2 * L]; [+1.2 * L +1.2 * L +1.2 * L]])
````

For each finite element set in the array `fesa`, generate the graphics to
represent that object.

````julia
traces = let traces = tbox
    for fes in fesa
        labl  = fes.label[1]
        tm = plot_solid(fens, fes; facecolor=colors[labl]);
        traces = cat(traces, tm; dims = 1)
    end
    traces
end
````

The layout of the plot is defined with simple defaults.

````julia
layout = default_layout_3d(;width=900, height=900)
````

Next, the graphics is rendered, and may be interacted with by zooming,
panning, etc.

````julia
pl = render(traces; layout = layout)
````

## Visualizing the nodes

In order to be able to discern the nodes we will reduce the opacity of the
surfaces representing the beams, otherwise the nodes would be hidden by these
surfaces. The geometry is defined in the same way as above.

````julia
tbox = plot_space_box([[-1.2 * L -1.2 * L -1.2 * L]; [+1.2 * L +1.2 * L +1.2 * L]])
traces = let traces = tbox
    for fes in fesa
        labl  = fes.label[1]
        tm = plot_solid(fens, fes; facecolor=colors[labl], opacity = 0.3);
        traces = cat(traces, tm; dims = 1)
    end
    traces
end
````

Next we add to the "traces" the graphics representing all the nodes in the
model as bright red dots.

````julia
using VisualStructures: plot_nodes
traces = cat(traces, plot_nodes(fens; color = "rgb(255, 15, 5)"); dims = 1)
````

Finally, the graphics is presented.

````julia
layout = default_layout_3d(;width=900, height=900)
pl = render(traces; layout = layout)

nothing
````
